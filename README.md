# SpaceX Rockets (React)

This simple SPA for listing SpaceX rockets was created for learning and demonstration purposes, and for comparing React.js with Vue.js framework.

Features:

- Functional components with Hooks (catching up with general push towards functional programming in JS and React)
- Optimized API calls for a single rocket
- Search with debounce
- Responsive design
- Simple unit tests in Jest

NOTE: Fetching all rockets will get all the necessary data for displaying a single rocket, but for the sake of the demo we are fetching data for a single rocket as well.

Rocket as Resource was picked because space rockets are cool nowadays :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
